# Day 8/30 days with Python

drink = input('What drink is available? ')

if drink == "soda":
     print('I will like to purchase')
else:
     if drink == 'juice':
          print('I will purchase juice')
     else:
          print('I will purchase water')


# Practice: 
# 1. Declare a variable called month
# 2. Asign the variable input (Ask the user the month they were born?) born?)
# 3. If Febraury, print "You are lucky to be born in Febraury"
