# Appending List Items 

_With your knowledge with Lists and various methods, write a  `for` loop that `append` to an empty list._ 

1. Create an empty list with the variable name called `int_list`.
2. Run a f`forloop` with range of `10`
3. Every time the loop runs, update the empty list with `int_list.append(i)`
4. Finally, exit the loop and print `int_list`

```python
# EXPECTED OUTPUT

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
